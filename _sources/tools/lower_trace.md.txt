# IR Lower Trace

IR Lower Trace shows how TileLang's TIR changes as compiler passes run. It
transparently captures the IR before and after *every* pass in the compilation
pipeline — including the final codegen step that produces C/CUDA/HIP source —
and renders a human-readable diff report in the terminal and/or a self-contained
HTML page. No code changes are required: enabling a single environment variable
is enough.

IR Lower Trace is the recommended successor to {doc}`pass_diff`. Compared with
the older `TILELANG_PASS_DIFF` tool, it adds:

- **Phase context** — each pass is tagged with its pipeline phase (e.g.
  `pipeline_c`, `phase1_...`), so you can tell which backend stage a pass
  belongs to.
- **Codegen capture** — the final TIR-to-source lowering is recorded, and the
  generated C/CUDA/HIP code is dropped to disk for inspection or editing.
- **Edit-and-recompile workflow** — edit the generated codegen source on disk
  and rerun; your edits are injected back into compilation (with conflict
  detection).
- **Per-compilation isolation** — each kernel compilation owns its records,
  pass indices, pipeline scopes, and report lifecycle. Concurrent kernels do
  not write into one shared in-memory trace.
- **Raw `.tir` dumps** — before/after IR for every pass is written to disk,
  keyed by phase and pass index.
- **Crash-safe incremental HTML** — the report is flushed after every pass, so
  partial results survive even if the process crashes.
- **Enhanced HTML report** — sidebar pass navigation, status dots, phase tabs,
  `j`/`k` keyboard navigation, `Shift+E` global expand, `F7` manual alignment,
  dark/light theme.

## Observe the Lowering Pipeline

The simplest way to enable IR Lower Trace is to set the `TL_LOWER_TRACE`
environment variable before running your script:

```bash
# HTML report (default when set to 1/on/true/yes)
TL_LOWER_TRACE=1 python3 my_script.py

# Colored diff printed to the terminal only
TL_LOWER_TRACE=terminal python3 my_script.py

# Both terminal output and HTML report
TL_LOWER_TRACE=both python3 my_script.py

# Disabled (default — zero overhead, no patching)
python3 my_script.py
```

TileLang reads this setting when `tilelang` is imported and registers a tool
factory for future compilation sessions. It does not patch TVM's default
`PassContext` or global codegen functions. To change the setting after import,
call `enable()` programmatically.

When HTML output is enabled, a stable symlink `<script_dir>/report.html` is
maintained and points to the latest run's report. Open it directly in a browser:

```bash
# typical location
open tmp/lower_trace_dir/my_script/report.html
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TL_LOWER_TRACE` | Enable tracing. Values: `0`/`off`/`false`/`no` (off), `1`/`on`/`true`/`yes` (→ html), `terminal`, `html`, `both` | off |
| `TL_LOWER_TRACE_DIR` | Base output directory for all trace artifacts | `./tmp/lower_trace_dir` |

### Output Directory Structure

A single run produces the following layout under `TL_LOWER_TRACE_DIR`:

```text
<TL_LOWER_TRACE_DIR>/
└── <script_name>/                      # derived from sys.argv[0], e.g. "my_script"
    ├── report.html                # symlink → latest run's report
    ├── codegen.cpp                     # generated codegen source (editable, see below)
    ├── codegen.cpp.original            # baseline snapshot for edit/recompile workflow
    ├── codegen.cpp.latest              # actual codegen output of the most recent run
    └── .run_records/
        └── run_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_ffffff>_<pid>_<unique-id>/
            ├── report.html        # this run's full report
            ├── pipeline_c/             # one subdir per phase (example)
            │   ├── 00_BindTarget_before.tir
            │   ├── 00_BindTarget_after.tir
            │   ├── 01_Simplify_before.tir
            │   └── 01_Simplify_after.tir
            ├── phase2_optimize/        # another phase (illustrative)
            │   └── ...
            ├── codegen/
            │   ├── 42_codegen_before.tir
            │   └── 42_codegen_after.cpp
            └── unscoped/               # passes outside any pipeline window
                └── ...
```

Each phase gets its own subdirectory; passes are numbered globally (`00_`, `01_`,
…) so ordering is unambiguous. Codegen records write the *after* artifact as
`.cpp` (the generated source), while ordinary passes use `.tir` for both sides.

## Programmatic API

For fine-grained control, IR Lower Trace exposes two layers of API.

### One-shot: `lower_trace()`

Diff a fixed chain of passes against an IR module without installing any global
hook:

```python
from tilelang.tools import lower_trace as lt
from tilelang import tvm
import tilelang.transform as transform

# Diff a single pass
results = lt.lower_trace(func, transform.Simplify(), mode="terminal")

# Diff a named chain, write an HTML report
results = lt.lower_trace(
    func,
    [
        ("Annotate",   tvm.tirx.transform.AnnotateDeviceRegions()),
        ("Split",      tvm.tirx.transform.SplitHostDevice()),
        ("ThreadSync", transform.ThreadSync("shared")),
    ],
    mode="both",
    html_path="my_diff.html",
)
```

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `func_or_mod` | A `PrimFunc` or `IRModule` to run passes on | Required |
| `passes` | A single pass, a list of passes, or a list of `(name, pass)` tuples | Required |
| `mode` | `"terminal"`, `"html"`, or `"both"` | `terminal` |
| `context` | Number of context lines in the unified diff | `3` |
| `html_path` | Output path for the HTML report | `lower_trace_report.html` |

Returns a `list[dict]` with one entry per pass step, each containing `name`,
`before_script`, `after_script`, `diff_lines`, `insertions`, `deletions`, and
`changed`.

### Compilation instrumentation: `enable()` / `disable()`

To trace the *entire* compilation pipeline of a real kernel (what the
environment variable does, but programmatically):

```python
from tilelang.tools import lower_trace as lt

# Enable tracing for the rest of the process.
lt.enable(mode="both")

# ... run tilelang.compile() / kernel compilation ...
```

All three parameters of `lt.enable()` are optional — `mode`, `trace_dir`, and
`codegen_output` fall back to the `TL_LOWER_TRACE` / `TL_LOWER_TRACE_DIR` env
vars (or sensible defaults) when omitted.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | Force a trace mode: `"terminal"`, `"html"`, `"both"`, or `None` to disable. | `TL_LOWER_TRACE` env var |
| `trace_dir` | Base output directory. | `TL_LOWER_TRACE_DIR`, then `./tmp/lower_trace_dir` |
| `codegen_output` | Path to save the generated codegen source (enables the edit-recompile workflow). Pass `None` explicitly to suppress. Defaults to `<script_dir>/codegen.cpp` in `html`/`both` mode; `None` (no file) in `terminal` mode unless overridden. |

`enable()` is idempotent — calling it multiple times is safe. Its values are
snapshotted when a compilation begins, so changing them cannot mutate a kernel
that is already compiling.

#### When to use `disable()`

| Function | When to call | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `disable()` | You want to **disable tracing for subsequent compilations** within the same process (e.g. a long-running service that only traces the first kernel) | Unregisters the tool factory. A compilation already in progress keeps its own session and completes normally. |

```python
from tilelang.tools import lower_trace as lt

lt.enable(mode="both")

# First kernel — traced.
kernel1 = tilelang.compile(func_a)

# Second kernel — traced into its own session and report automatically.
kernel2 = tilelang.compile(func_b)

# Optional: disable tracing for any further compilations.
lt.disable()
```

:::{note}
If `lt.disable()` is not called, tracing stays active for future compilations.
Each HTML report is finalized when its owning compilation exits, including when
that compilation raises.
:::

## HTML Report Features

The HTML report is a single self-contained file (no external assets) providing:

- **Sidebar** with per-pass navigation, status dots (● changed / ○ no-op / ✕
  failed / ◆ codegen), and `+`/`−` line-count statistics. Collapsible and
  drag-resizable.
- **Phase tabs** to filter passes by pipeline phase.
- **Summary bar** with clickable filter badges (changed / failed / codegen).
- **Side-by-side diff** with GitHub-style coloring, word-level inline
  highlighting, and collapsible context (`↑↓ Expand` buttons reveal hidden equal
  lines).
- **Keyboard navigation** — `j`/`k` to move between passes, `Shift+E` to
  expand/collapse all, `F7` for Beyond-Compare-style manual alignment.
- **Dark/Light theme toggle** persisted via `localStorage`.
- **Copy buttons** for before/after IR of any pass.
- **Error boxes** — a failed pass shows its exception message alongside the IR
  *before* the crash.

## Codegen Source Capture & Edit-Recompile Workflow

When tracing is enabled, the final codegen step (TIR → C/CUDA/HIP/…) is
intercepted. The generated source is written to `<script_dir>/codegen.cpp` (or
the path passed to `codegen_output=`), so you can inspect — and even edit — the
code that will actually be compiled.

To support editing the generated code and re-running with your edits applied,
IR Lower Trace maintains **three cooperating files**:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `codegen.cpp` | **Working copy** — user-editable. This is what gets compiled when you rerun. |
| `codegen.cpp.original` | **Baseline** — the codegen snapshot the working copy was last synced from. Written only on init or re-sync, never blindly overwritten. |
| `codegen.cpp.latest` | **Latest codegen output** — the actual output of the most recent run, overwritten every run for diff reference. |

On each run a three-way comparison (baseline / working copy / current codegen
output) decides how to proceed:

| Situation | `codegen.cpp` vs `.original` | `.latest` vs `.original` | Action | Console tag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No change | identical | identical | Compile with codegen output as-is | — |
| Codegen changed only | identical | **differs** | Regenerate `codegen.cpp` and `.original` from new codegen | `REGENERATED` |
| User edited only | **differs** | identical | Inject the working copy (`PATCHED`) | `PATCHED` |
| Both changed, working == latest | **differs** | **differs** (working matches latest) | Advance baseline; use working copy | `SYNCED` |
| Both changed, working != latest | **differs** | **differs** (working differs from latest) | **CONFLICT** — back up working copy → `.bak` (*conflict backup*) and old baseline → `.original.bak`, then regenerate from new codegen | `CONFLICT` |
| First run (no baseline) | — | — | Initialise `.original`, copy to `codegen.cpp` | (init) |
| `codegen.cpp` exists without baseline | — | — | Back up pre-existing `codegen.cpp` → `.bak` (*safety backup*), then initialise baseline | `INIT-BACKUP` |

> **Note on `.bak` files:** The backups created by `CONFLICT` and `INIT-BACKUP`
> serve different purposes. `INIT-BACKUP` preserves a pre-existing
> `codegen.cpp` of unknown origin before the trace tool takes it over.
> `CONFLICT` preserves the user's edits before a codegen change overwrites them.
> Recover `CONFLICT` edits with
> `diff codegen.cpp.original.bak codegen.cpp.bak`.

### Typical Workflow

1. **Inspect** — Run once with `TL_LOWER_TRACE=1`. Open `codegen.cpp` to read
   the generated source.
2. **Edit** — Modify `codegen.cpp` (e.g. add a `printf`, tweak a loop). Do *not*
   touch `.original`.
3. **Rerun** — Run again. Because `codegen.cpp` differs from `.original` but
   codegen output is unchanged, you'll see `PATCHED from …/codegen.cpp` and your
   edited source is compiled.
4. **Iterate** — Keep editing and rerunning. Each run re-injects your working
   copy.
5. **If codegen itself changes** (e.g. you modified the TileLang program) — two
   outcomes:
   - If your edits happen to match the new codegen output → `SYNCED` (baseline
     advances, your edits preserved).
   - If both your edits and codegen changed and they differ → `CONFLICT`. Your
     working copy is backed up to `codegen.cpp.bak` and the old baseline to
     `codegen.cpp.original.bak`. Recover your edits with
     `diff codegen.cpp.original.bak codegen.cpp.bak`, then re-apply them against
     the freshly regenerated `codegen.cpp`.

:::{note}
**Backend requirements for edit-and-recompile.** The edit-and-recompile
workflow requires a source-compiling execution backend — `nvrtc`, `cython`, or
`cutedsl`. These backends use `*_without_compile` codegen FFIs that produce
source-only modules, then compile the (edited) source string at runtime via
NVRTC / Cython / CuTeDSL.

The default `tvm_ffi` backend pre-compiles device code to a binary (PTX/hsaco)
from TIR during codegen. When the `tvm_ffi` backend is active and you edit
`codegen.cpp`, you'll see a `NOTE` message indicating that your edits are
recorded in the trace for diff viewing but were **not recompiled**. To use
edit-and-recompile, switch to a source-compiling backend:

```python
# For CUDA targets:
tilelang.compile(..., execution_backend="nvrtc")

# For HIP targets:
tilelang.compile(..., execution_backend="cython")
```
:::

## How It Works

Instrumentation sessions are owned by complete compiler entry points such as
`tilelang.compile()`, `tilelang.lower()`, and grouped compilation. Lower-level
pipeline and codegen components contribute events to the active session but do
not create standalone sessions themselves.

IR Lower Trace uses three cooperating layers:

1. **TVM `PassInstrument`** — before/after callbacks capture `str(mod)`,
   compute `+`/`−` line counts, and append a `LowerRecord`. The shared nested
   callback stack records depth and parent relationships, including passes
   invoked internally by another TVM pass. Passes outside a pipeline window
   are tagged with the `unscoped` phase.
2. **Explicit `PassPipeline.lower` scope** — contributes a context-local phase
   to the caller-owned session so passes in a backend pipeline are grouped
   under labels such as `pipeline_c`. The pipeline does not create or finalize
   the compile session. This is a normal pipeline boundary, not a class
   monkey-patch.
3. **Explicit backend codegen hook** — TileLang's device/host codegen registry
   routes each `target.build.*` call through the active compile session. This
   captures final TIR → source lowering and drives the three-file
   edit-recompile workflow without replacing a process-global FFI. When no
   session is active, the registry invokes the underlying codegen directly.

Pass records are appended **at runtime** (not pre-registered), so conditional
passes that are skipped at runtime — e.g. `LetInline` when
`should_force_let_inline()` is `False` — simply do not appear, leaving no
phantom/skipped slots. The HTML report is flushed **incrementally** after every
pass (O(n) total cost), so partial results survive even a crash or `SIGKILL`.

When one logical compilation uses multiple PassContexts (for example grouped
lowering followed by device and host codegen), they obtain fresh callback
objects from the same compile session. Their records share one monotonic index
inside that session. A different compilation starts from index zero with a new
record list.

:::{note}
`enable()` affects TileLang-managed compilation sessions only; it never mutates
the PassContext that happens to be current at enable time. For a standalone TVM
PassContext, `lt.create_pass_instrument()` remains available for manual use.
Capturing IR and, in HTML mode, rewriting the report after every pass adds
debugging overhead. Leave the feature disabled for normal builds and benchmarks.
:::

## Choosing an Output Mode

- Use `terminal` for a small number of passes and immediate feedback.
- Use `html` when a lowering pipeline produces many changes or you need to
  compare complete before and after scripts.
- Use `both` when iterating interactively but retaining a shareable report.

IR Lower Trace compares the textual form returned by `IRModule.script()`. A
textual change is useful evidence about a pass, but it does not by itself
establish a semantic or performance change.

## Tips

- **Use `terminal` mode for quick checks** — the colored diff prints as passes
  run, so you can see changes in real time.
- **Use `html` mode for thorough analysis** — navigate across many passes,
  expand hidden context, and copy IR snippets.
- **Combine with `TL_LOWER_TRACE_DIR`** to direct reports to a specific
  location, e.g. when running in CI or comparing across runs.
- **The hook captures all passes** in the lowering pipeline, including those
  triggered internally by `tilelang.compile()`. This makes it useful for
  understanding the full compilation flow.
- **If you previously used `TILELANG_PASS_DIFF`**, switch to `TL_LOWER_TRACE` —
  it is a strict superset and is the tool that receives future improvements.
