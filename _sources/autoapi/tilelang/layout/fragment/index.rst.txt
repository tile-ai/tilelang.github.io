.. py:class:: Fragment(shape, forward_fn=None, forward_thread_fn=None, replicate=1, forward_index_fn=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`tilelang.layout.Layout`


   A Fragment layout object that encapsulates iteration variables (forward_vars),
   thread iteration variables (forward_thread), and index transformations
   (forward_index). This class supports replication (thread_replicate) and
   index mapping for fine-grained control over multi-dimensional data layouts.


   .. py:property:: thread

      Returns the forward_thread (IterVar) of the Fragment, representing
      the thread dimension or mapping.


   .. py:method:: get_thread_size()

      Returns the extent (range size) of the thread dimension.
      If the Fragment was replicated over threads, this will reflect
      the number of threads.



   .. py:method:: repeat(repeats, repeat_on_thread = False, lower_dim_first = True)

      Returns a new Fragment that repeats the iteration space a given number of times.

      :param repeats: Number of times to repeat.
      :type repeats: int
      :param repeat_on_thread: If set, the repeat will happen on the thread dimension.
      :type repeat_on_thread: bool, optional
      :param lower_dim_first: If set to True, repeat on lower dimensions first.
      :type lower_dim_first: bool, optional

      :returns: A new Fragment with the repeated iteration space.
      :rtype: Fragment



   .. py:method:: replicate(replicate)

      Replicate the Fragment across a new thread dimension.

      :param replicate: The replication factor or number of threads.
      :type replicate: int

      :returns: A new Fragment with an additional replicate dimension.
      :rtype: Fragment



   .. py:method:: condense_rep_var()

      Condense or fold the replicate variable into the existing iteration space.
      This operation may be used to reduce dimensionality if the replicate variable
      is no longer needed as a separate dimension.

      :returns: A new Fragment where the replicate variable is condensed.
      :rtype: Fragment



   .. py:method:: map_forward_thread(indices)

      Get the thread mapping expression for a given set of argument indices.

      :param indices: Indices for which to compute the thread mapping.
      :type indices: list of PrimExpr

      :returns: The computed thread expression for the provided indices.
      :rtype: PrimExpr



   .. py:method:: __repr__()

      String representation of the Fragment for debugging and logging.

      :returns: A string showing the thread dimension and the index dimension.
      :rtype: str



   .. py:method:: is_equal(other)

      Check if the current fragment is equal to another fragment.
